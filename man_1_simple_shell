.SH NAME
simple_shell - a shell (standard command line interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [-abcDefg] [arguement ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
<<<<<<< HEAD
The hsh utility reads and interprets a command line string, either in interactive or non-interactive mode. It then executes commands based on the input.  Both the local directory and PATH are searched.
When applicable, the  function prints to stdout or stderr, the standard output and error stream, respectively.
In interactive mode, the shell will prompt with \' $ \', and proess the entered input upon a return stroke.  In non-interactive mode, standard output must be piped into the executable.
.SH USAGE
In addition to searching the path, the following features are supported.
   exit - Exit shell with a specified exit status
   env - Print a list of the environment variables
   setenv - Set a new environment variable
   unsetenv - Unset an environment variable
   cd - Change directories
   help - Prints help for built-ins
   history - Displays numbered history list and prints to history file on exit
   Ctrl-D - End of file: exit shell
   Ctrl-C - Does NOT exit shell
   ; - Command separator for command chaining
   # - Comment indicator
   && - AND Logical operator
   || - OR Logical operator
   < << >> > - Left and Right stream redirection
   | - Pipe stream redirection
   $? $$ - variable replacement   
   FILE - Can take a file as command line argument
   $PS1 - Customizable PS1 prompt variable
=======
This program is a simple shell. It contains basic features and functions found in other shell programs.
.SS Overview
This shell is an executable that reads lines from the prompt, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It runs by compiling all .c files in the repository to create an executable
.SS Path Search
When locating a command, this shell first looks to see if it has an executable by that name in the PATH of env. Then it looks for builtin commands by that name.
